# 2048-puzzle

2048 is a popular puzzle game that was created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. 
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid and combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where each tile represents a power of 2. 
Initially, there are two tiles on the grid, randomly displaying the number 2 or 4. 
The player can slide the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right. 
When the player moves the tiles, they all slide as far as possible in the chosen direction, either merging with another tile of the same number or stopping at the edge of the grid.

When two tiles with the same number collide, they combine into a single tile that displays the sum of the two numbers. 
For example, if two tiles with the number 2 collide, they merge into a tile with the number 4. 
The goal is to keep combining tiles and creating larger numbers until you reach the tile displaying 2048.

The game ends when there are no more possible moves, such as when the grid is completely filled, and no adjacent tiles have the same number. At that point, the player's score is based on the numbers displayed on the tiles, and they can choose to continue playing or start a new game.

2048 is known for its simple rules and addictive gameplay, requiring strategic thinking and planning to reach the highest possible number.
